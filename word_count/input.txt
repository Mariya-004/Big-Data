Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows for the distributed 
processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using 
simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single 
servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation 
and storage. The Hadoop framework handles the massive amount of 
data in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner.
